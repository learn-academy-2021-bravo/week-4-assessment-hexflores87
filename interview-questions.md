# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable is when youre creating an instance inside the varaible. Calling on the instances or instantiating is another term when you are calling upon an action. 

  Researched answer: In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: I remember the blocks challenge while i was driving and not navigating that you needed a d0 in the process. 

  Researched answer:Ruby has anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are called blocks. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: From the note-taking I did under this topic I remember writing over and over that its when the return is automated once you return something in ruby without typing return.

  Researched answer: Ruby has an implicit return, which means the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return.





4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: From week-3-assessment this was apart of the looking ahead vocabulary. I remember the acronym OOP which was creating objects that contain data.

  Researched answer: Ruby has anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are called blocks. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method. The difference from OOP to functional programming 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: The difference is the object is called as an instance of a class. So say the bike is the class, the wheels, speed, model, are objects

  Researched answer: An object is a unit of data. A class is what kind of data it is.



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: This allows the child classs to extract the information from the parent class. 

  Researched answer: In Ruby, attr_accessor automatically sets up getters and setters for instance variables. Using attr_accessor allows us to set and get values from outside of the class.





## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: uby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. 

3. CRUD:  computer programming, create, read, update, and delete are the four basic operations of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic operations of CRUD, such as construct instead of create, retrieve instead of read, or destroy or destruct instead of delete. 


4. ORM: Object–relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language

5. Active Record: In software engineering, the active record pattern is considered an architectural pattern by some people and as an anti-pattern by some others recently. It is found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases
